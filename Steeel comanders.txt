Over hundred years ago since we first rode into fire
The rulers of the battlefield rolling over trench and wire
Into battle, no retreat, roll out, for our foes we spell disaster
In the footsteps of Montgomery, Patton followed we came after
Flers–Courcelette showed the way
Evolution leading to
El-Alamein until today
We're the first ones into the fray
Steel Commanders
Rule the battlefield
Spearhead Flanders
Tankers leading the
Storm of panzers
Battle calling the
Steel Commanders
From the Mark 1's introduction to the beast known as the Leopard
With our Chieftains and Centurions, our frontline has been tempered
From the fields of Prokhorovka, to the shores of Overlord
The beginning of the victory, Shermans rolling on to Sword
Flers–Courcelette showed the way
Evolution leading to
El-Alamein until today
We're the first ones into the fray
Steel Commanders
Rule the battlefield
Spearhead Flanders
Tankers leading the
Storm of panzers
Battle calling the
Steel Commanders
Steel Commanders
Spearhead Flanders
Storm of panzers
Steel Commanders
Steel Commanders
Rule the battlefield
Spearhead Flanders
Tankers leading the
Storm of panzers
Battle calling the
Steel Commanders
